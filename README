Sample go micro service for processing dicom files.

It's pretty simple actually, mostly all living inside a single
function. If the design ever needed to increase in scope then it'll
need some refactoring but this gets the job done fast enough in a
clear and concise way. KISS principles and all that

Some test cases/benchmarks/metrics/telemetry would be nice but the
size of this service doesn't really warrant that since the cost of
throwing it all away and rewriting it from scratch is so low. Maybe
get an AI to write it all out but that would just clutter it up right
now and defeat the purpose of having a clean demonstration.
